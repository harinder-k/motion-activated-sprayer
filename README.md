# Motion-Activated Sprayer

This is a fun little project that involves making a motion-sensing water sprayer, with the ability to enable and disable it using WiFi.

## Materials

- NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller development board
- PIR Sensor (I used Oiyagai HC-SR501 from Amazon)
- Automatic Electric Spray Bottle
- Wires
- Velcro or other adhesive
*Optional*
- Breakout Board for ESP8266 (I used KeeYees ESP8266 Breakout Board from Amazon)
- Arduino IDE software - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

## Setup

Coming Soon(TM)

## Usage

With your board running the code, go to 192.168.1.184 on a device connected to the same WiFi network as the NodeMCU ESP8266 board. When ready to enable, press the ARM buttom. At any time, disable the operation using the DISARM button.
